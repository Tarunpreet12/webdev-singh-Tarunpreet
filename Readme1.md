About Me

My name is Tarunpreet Singh. I am a grad student pursuing my masters in computer science. this is my last semester. I have approximately 3 years of experience 
little mor than 2 years beofre my masters and 8 months on my co-op. 
some projects I worked on are as follows:
Helmuth Labs
•	Developed an automated system for Marine and Environmental Science Researchers around the world
 using Python, HTML/CSS and MySQL to fetch the logged data from last 20 years in queried form.
 
Web Crawler & Small Search Engine 
•	Developed the web crawler using Python and elastic search. The crawler crawls the links within links of a particular webpage till it reaches certain depth. Search Engine was information retrieval system and index of web pages (CACM Corpus). The output of this search engine is a list of documents ranked for the given set of queries as input.

PageRank & BM25 Algorithm                                                                                                                    ●	Implemented PageRank & BM25 algorithm using Python. PageRank calculates the rank of the webpage depending 
  upon the factors like in links, out links and key phrases. BM25 ranks matching documents according to their relevance
  to a given search query.
  
  During my recent co-op I worked on the following things
  ● Implemented and upgraded the internal Public Key infrastructure from SHA1 to SHA256 algorithm using C#.
  ● Developed a web application "LifeYield Internal Portal" for internal use which has all the important information like Employee's 
    directory and maintaining it in an SQL database, web links to every single company's product to all the environments 
    (dev,QA,Prod) using  ASP.net following MVC architectural pattern.           
  ● Implemented an audit service to track down all the sent requests and received responses by the user to our company's multi 
    account portfolio software using C#.
